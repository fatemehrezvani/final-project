Ireland win eclipses refereeing  errors  International Rugby Board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly up It may have to go  whole way and have NFL style video cameras all over  field  or slap  vociferous perpetrators over  knuckles  What  IRB does not want is a football scenario where  verbal slanging matches often overshadow  game itself  Sunday s explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road was a good example as Ireland took anor step towards ir first Grand Slam since 1948   game was as exciting as it comes  with a much improved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go ir way  One can understand that frustration  re was no doubt that Ireland had  rub of  green in ir 19 13 victory  but  reaction from  England camp may not have endeared m to  sport s  blazers  Referee Jonathan Kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him  villain of  piece  I doubt wher Kaplan would have been too pleased at  comments made  After all  he has no public recourse to criticism It was  same for Simon McDowell   touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after ir defeat against France  As far as England were concerned  re were queries over Mark Cueto s first half effort when he went over in  corner from a Charlie Hodgson kick England coach Andy Robinson referred to a similar case at Ravenhill in January when Ulster were playing Gloucester in  Heineken Cup  On that occasion  David Humphreys kicked to Tommy Bowe  who touched down in  corner only for  try to be wiped out  But you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies  Perhaps Robinson was right to say  referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey was driven over  Irish line near  end Lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control  However  one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O Connor for cleverly scooping  ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown  But in rugby  everything tends to even out over  80 minutes   referee also missed England s Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan O Gara off  ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to  line  Those were  stand out moments in a classic game between  two old foes But re were many more  and one should not take away from those  Brian O Driscoll s winning try was as well conceived as y come  while Charlie Hodgson s brilliant kicking display was anor highlight  And Ronan O Gara s tremendous ability to control  game was also a crucial component  But  defining moments came with Ireland under  cosh in  final 15 minutes  Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on   first was Denis Hickie s brilliant double tackle in  right hand corner  He gobbled up Cueto from anor Hodgson cross field kick  n regained his feet to stop Lewsey from scoring a certain try  Ireland s second row colossus Paul O Connell was equally superb  England had turned Ireland one way n  or  and  defence cordon was slowly disintegrating  England prop Matt Stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers  Unfortunately he ran into O Connell who hit him hard   very hard   and n wrestled  ball away for a crucial turnover  That spoke volumes about Ireland s back foot display  with defensive coach Mike Ford taking a bow at  end  To win a game like that showed that Ireland have moved forward  It may be tries that win games  but it is defence that wins championships	ireland win eclipses refereeing errors  international

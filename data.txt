Bates seals takeoverKen Bates has completed his takeover of Leeds United The 73 year old former Chelsea chairman sealed the deal at 0227 GMT on Friday  and has bought a 50  stake in the club  He said   I m delighted to be stepping up to the mantel at such a fantastic club  I recognise Leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times   We have a lot of hard work ahead to get the club back where it belongs in the Premiership  and with the help of our fans we will do everything we can  Bates bought his stake under the guise of a Geneva based company known as The Forward Sports Fund  He revealed that part of his plan is to buy back Leeds  Elland Road stadium and Thorp Arch training ground in due course  It s going to be a tough jon and the first task is to stabilise the cash flow and sort out the remaining creditors  Bates added   But there is light at the end of a very long tunnel  For the past year it has been a matter of firefighting   now we can start running the club again  Outgoing Leeds chairman Gerald Krasner said   This deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and I believe Mr Bates  proposals are totally for the benefit of the club   We are content that under Mr Bates  Leeds United will continue to consolidate and move forward   When we took over Leeds United in March 2004  the club had a debt of £103m  since that date  my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under £25m   We worked tirelessly to solve all of the problems at Leeds United   Eighty percent of the problems have already been overcome and we came to this agreement with Mr Bates to secure its ongoing success  Krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth hand over  He will stay on in an unpaid capacity while Peter Lorimer will continue in his role as director and point of contact for the fans and Peter McCormick will serve as a consultant to the incoming board  The other outgoing directors have agreed to leave their loans of £4 5m in the company for the next four years  On Leeds  new look board it is understood that Lorimer will be joined by former Chelsea finance director Yvonne Todd and Bates  lawyer Mark Taylor Krasner refused to give any details of the finances involved in the takeover  He told BBC Five Live   I am not going into the figures  If Ken wants to give them up that is up to him  I can not tell you what the money will be used for   This dea l is not about money for the current board  In the last four months I never saw any cheques until this week from one person  I am not stretching figures  we don t discuss internal arrangements  Bates stepped down as Chelsea chairman in March last year following Roman Abramovich s £140m takeover at Stamford Bridge  In May  he made a proposal to invest £10m in Sheffield Wednesday  but this was rejected by the club  Sebastien Sainsbury had been close to a takeover of Leeds but withdrew his £25m offer last week His efforts failed after he revealed it would take £40m to stage a takeover  and that the club will also lose £10m over the next six months  The club was on the brink of administration   and the deduction of 10 points by the Football League   before Bates  arrival but his investment has spared them that prospect	Bates seals takeoverKen Bates has completed his takeover of Leeds

Ireland win eclipses refereeing  errors The International Rugby Board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly up It may have to go the whole way and have NFL style video cameras all over the field  or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles  What the IRB does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself  Sunday s explosive Six Nations clash at Lansdowne Road was a good example as Ireland took another step towards their first Grand Slam since 1948  The game was as exciting as it comes  with a much improved England side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way  One can understand that frustration  There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19 13 victory  but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sport s  blazers  Referee Jonathan Kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece  I doubt whether Kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made  After all  he has no public recourse to criticism It was the same for Simon McDowell  the touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France  As far as England were concerned  there were queries over Mark Cueto s first half effort when he went over in the corner from a Charlie Hodgson kick England coach Andy Robinson referred to a similar case at Ravenhill in January when Ulster were playing Gloucester in the Heineken Cup  On that occasion  David Humphreys kicked to Tommy Bowe  who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out  But you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies  Perhaps Robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when Josh Lewsey was driven over the Irish line near the end Lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control  However  one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O Connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown  But in rugby  everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes  The referee also missed England s Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan O Gara off the ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to the line  Those were the stand out moments in a classic game between the two old foes But there were many more  and one should not take away from those  Brian O Driscoll s winning try was as well conceived as they come  while Charlie Hodgson s brilliant kicking display was another highlight  And Ronan O Gara s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component  But the defining moments came with Ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes  Two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied England and allowed Ireland to hold on  The first was Denis Hickie s brilliant double tackle in the right hand corner  He gobbled up Cueto from another Hodgson cross field kick  then regained his feet to stop Lewsey from scoring a certain try  Ireland s second row colossus Paul O Connell was equally superb  England had turned Ireland one way then the other  and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating  England prop Matt Stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers  Unfortunately he ran into O Connell who hit him hard   very hard   and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover  That spoke volumes about Ireland s back foot display  with defensive coach Mike Ford taking a bow at the end  To win a game like that showed that Ireland have moved forward  It may be tries that win games  but it is defence that wins championships	Ireland win eclipses refereeing  errors The International Rugby Board may have to step in to
